#Extra notes from the chapter 1 below this example
tomato = 7.7
tomato = int(tomato)+1 #You can round a float by setting it to a int and adding 1
                        #You can round it down by deleteing that +1

print(tomato)

print("I want this to print 5 times"*5) #You can use * to print something multiple times

#Practice questons
#1. * - / + are operators 'hello' -88.8 5 are values
#2. varaible is spam string is 'string'
#3. three data types are float string and integer
#4. An expressions are made up of values. They evaluate or reduce to a single value.
#5. A statement is telling the machine to set something to a value expression works with the values
#6. 20 because it is not resetting bacon to equal the 20 + 1
#7. spamspamspam and spamspamspam
#8. Cannot begin with a number when talking variable names
#9. int() float() str()
#10. You can not put an int and string together when printing you could make the 99 into str(99) to fix it
#Test

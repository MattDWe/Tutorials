// Basics of compiling and executing example

public class Ex1{
  public static void main(String[] args){
    System.out.println("Welcome to Java!");
    System.out.println("Thanks ~Matt");
    System.out.println((10.5+2*3)/(45-3.5));
  }
}

/* Notes
For setting up download the jdk and setup path for java to be able to compile
Don't forget those semicolons
The public class has to share the same name as the file
When compiling do javac name.javac running the program use java name
Programs are case sensitive

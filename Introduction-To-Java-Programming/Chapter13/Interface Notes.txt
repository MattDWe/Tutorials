// An interface is a class like construct that contains only constants and abstract methods
// use is "class subclass name extends superclass name implements interface name"
// When creating an interface put that as the modifier
// Using interfaces and the compareTo method you can compare objects in order to sort them
// Using the interface cloneable you can implement way to clone a object

A class can implement multiple interfaces but it can only extend one superclass
For interfaces all variables must be public static final and do not contain constructors
Abstract constructors are invoked by a subclass through constructor chaining
